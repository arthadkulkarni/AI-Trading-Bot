Implemented a trading bot using quantconnect (https://www.quantconnect.com/) in order to write and test the code. The trading but has shown that is able to bring consistent profits through quantconnects testing plots/graphs. The code has been tested on multiple stocks in order for the most accurate results. The code uses the numpy library in order for the algorithm to work to its full potential. The graphs and data that the algorithme is tested on dates back multiple years in order for the most accurate representation.
